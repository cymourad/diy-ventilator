# DIY-Ventilator Tests
These are some basic test cases to run the ventilator through once you assemble it and before you let a patient use it.
You can also run them whenever you want.
** All the tests assume that all the parts of the ventilator are assembled correctly.

## User Acceptance Tests

### User Acceptance Test 1
##### Settings
| Setting   | Configuration   |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Setting 1 | Configuration 1 |
| Setting 2 | Configuration 2 |
| Setting 3 | Configuration 3 |
##### Expected Ventilator Behavior
Describe what the behavior would look/sound like (ex:high noise, low noise, if you put your hand at the tube you would feel presure, etc).
Might also wanna explain when these settings would be applied (the condition of the patient that requires these settings), and maybe how these settings would help the patient.
##### How to Meausre the Success of the Test
Describe the sesnors/mechanisms needed to ensure the ventilator behaves as expected.

### User Acceptance Test 2
##### Settings
| Setting   | Configuration   |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Setting 1 | Configuration 1 |
| Setting 2 | Configuration 2 |
| Setting 3 | Configuration 3 |
##### Expected Ventilator Behavior
Describe what the behavior would look/sound like (ex:high noise, low noise, if you put your hand at the tube you would feel presure, etc).
Might also wanna explain when these settings would be applied (the condition of the patient that requires these settings), and maybe how these settings would help the patient.

### User Acceptance Test 3
##### Settings

## Engineering Tests
The following tests were used when developing the machine and we encourage anyone who decides to fork this design to run them when they make modifications. We would also encourage all developers and health professionals to add other tests as they see fit, or reach out to us to add them.

### Engineering Test 1
