# DIY-Ventilator
This is an attempt to make a simple DIY Ventilator using:
1. Standard mask, tubes, and Y-piece;
2. 3D printer and filament;
3. Arduino;
4. Choice of battery that outputs ## V and has capacity of ##;
5. AC / DC motor model #### (or a selection of motors);
6. Oxygen Condensator (or tank -> T.B.D.);
7. UV light / ULPA (device used to disinfect exhaled air -> T.B.D.)

## Files in the Respistory
This respository contains 6 directories:
### 1. app
This respository hosts the source code of two identical mobile applications (IOS and Android) to control and monitor the ventilator.
### 2. fw (FirmWare)
This directory contains the firmware code that would run on the Arduino baord to control the ventilator.
### 3. mech (Mechanical)
This directory contains the CAD files used to 3D print the custom parts of the ventilator.
### 4. prototypes
This directory is a sandbox for the team to share their early-stage design ideas, sketches, prototypes, etc.
### 5. resources
This directory contains all the references we used, as well as datasheets and manuals for readily-available parts that we used to build the ventilator.
### 6. tests
This directory includes User Acceptance Tests (UAT) to run on the assembled ventilator before the aptient uses it. It also includes tests to be run by the team as we develop the ventilator to make sure our changes are moving in the right direction.
### 7. tutorials
This directory includes the tutroials that the app will feature to educate operators on the assembly and use of the ventilator.
