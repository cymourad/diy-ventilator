for covid: they can do nothing on their own, we are gonna have a set rate


There are equations for the ventilator 
1sr level: just oxygen (no pressure)

C-pap and bipap: for consicous and moving patient

C-PAP: continuous (no oxygen in simplest form, positive pressure) --> makes pressure inside lung go higer and patient might resist it, but very easy and cheap

if oxygen is connected to cipap, we call it a ventilator

Bipap: same as cipap but makes expiration easy --> by going down to 4 cmH2O (atmospheric pressure) in intervals -> this interval is set between 14 and 16

we need a humidifer for both (has a small tank of ditilled water and is changed every couple of weeks) .. just room temperature, do not need to control temp

both ones above do not need blood work and are non-invasive

ventilator:
we have 4 settings depending on the condition of the patient
- CIMV: need xrays and samples that cannot be done at home (worst case scenario --> highest resistance possible to air coming in --> caused by collapsed/infiltrated lungs)
would need a doctor to monitor .. get other things 
- AC: assistend aor controlled ventilation 
- PSV: Pressure support ventilation
- BiPap (for weaning - make it non-invasive - oxygen would just be gping through the nose, most likely not needed)

ventilators are invasive .. so you need a professional to insert tube or else you might kill the patient

we monitor (with a different machine -- needed for everythong but bipap):
- blood pressure
- oxygen ceoncentration
- respiratpry rate
- heart rate

ventilator should monitor:
- pressure in lungs --> based on that we must 

there is an equation depending on height and weight, we decide the fllowing three controls: 
- tidal volume
- respositoary rate
- peep (pressure at end of expiration --> usually 3 cmH2O .. usuall

oxygen goes into ventialtor (you control how much oxygen goes in from the oxygen tank/condensator), then the ventilator humidifies this oxygen with air and controls its pressure and interval 

Common failure modes:
- tube slips to one lung (use stetoscope --> make sure air entry is equal bi-lateral)
- leakeage in connection (literallu go through connection manually)
- tube clog (by mucus or saliva -> use a small machine to eshfot)
